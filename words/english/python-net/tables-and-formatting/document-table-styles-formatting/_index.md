# Document Table Styles and Formatting using Aspose.Words Python


Document tables play a crucial role in presenting information in an organized and visually appealing manner. Aspose.Words for Python provides a powerful set of tools that allow developers to efficiently work with tables and customize their styles and formatting. In this article, we will explore how to manipulate and enhance document tables using the Aspose.Words for Python API. Let's dive in!

## Getting Started with Aspose.Words for Python

Before we dive into the specifics of document table styles and formatting, let's ensure you have the necessary tools set up:

1. Install Aspose.Words for Python: Begin by installing the Aspose.Words library using pip. This can be done with the following command:
   
    ```bash
    pip install aspose-words
    ```

2. Import the Library: Import the Aspose.Words library into your Python script using the following import statement:

    ```python
    import aspose.words as aw
    ```

3. Load a Document: Load an existing document or create a new one using the Aspose.Words API.

## Creating and Inserting Tables into Documents

To create and insert tables into documents using Aspose.Words for Python, follow these steps:

1. Create a Table: Use the `DocumentBuilder` class to create a new table and specify the number of rows and columns.

    ```python
    builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
    table = builder.start_table()
    ```

2. Insert Data: Add data to the table by using the builder's `insert_cell` and `write` methods.

    ```python
    builder.insert_cell()
    builder.write("Header 1")
    builder.insert_cell()
    builder.write("Header 2")
    builder.end_row()
    ```

3. Repeat Rows: Add rows and cells as needed, following a similar pattern.

4. Insert Table into Document: Finally, insert the table into the document using the `end_table` method.

    ```python
    builder.end_table()
    ```

## Applying Basic Table Formatting

Basic table formatting can be achieved using methods provided by the `Table` and `Cell` classes. Here's how you can enhance the appearance of your table:

1. Set Column Widths: Adjust the width of columns to ensure proper alignment and visual appeal.

    ```python
    for cell in table.first_row.cells:
        cell.cell_format.preferred_width = aw.PreferredWidth.from_points(100)
    ```

2. Cell Padding: Add padding to cells for improved spacing.

    ```python
    for row in table.rows:
        for cell in row.cells:
            cell.cell_format.set_paddings(10, 10, 10, 10)
    ```

3. Row Height: Customize row heights as needed.

    ```python
    for row in table.rows:
        row.row_format.height_rule = aw.HeightRule.AT_LEAST
        row.row_format.height = aw.ConvertUtil.inch_to_points(1)
    ```

## Merging and Splitting Cells for Complex Layouts

Creating complex table layouts often requires merging and splitting cells:

1. Merge Cells: Merge multiple cells to create a single larger cell.

    ```python
    table.rows[0].cells[0].cell_format.horizontal_merge = aw.CellMerge.FIRST
    table.rows[0].cells[1].cell_format.horizontal_merge = aw.CellMerge.PREVIOUS
    ```

2. Split Cells: Split cells back into their individual components.

    ```python
    cell.cell_format.horizontal_merge = aw.CellMerge.NONE
    ```

## Adding Borders and Shading to Tables

Enhance table appearance by adding borders and shading:

1. Borders: Customize borders for tables and cells.

    ```python
    table.set_borders(0.5, aw.LineStyle.SINGLE, aw.Color.from_rgb(0, 0, 0))
    ```

2. Shading: Apply shading to cells for a visually appealing effect.

    ```python
    cell.cell_format.shading.background_pattern_color = aw.Color.from_rgb(230, 230, 230)
    ```

## Working with Cell Content and Alignment

Efficiently manage cell content and alignment for better readability:

1. Cell Content: Insert content, such as text and images, into cells.

    ```python
    builder.insert_cell()
    builder.write("Hello, Aspose!")
    ```

2. Text Alignment: Align cell text as needed.

    ```python
    cell.paragraphs[0].paragraph_format.alignment = aw.ParagraphAlignment.CENTER
    ```

## Handling Table Headers and Footers

Incorporate headers and footers into your tables for better context:

1. Table Header: Set the first row as the header row.

    ```python
    table.rows[0].row_format.is_header = True
    ```

2. Table Footer: Create a footer row for additional information

    ```python
    footer_row = table.append_row()
    footer_row.cells[0].cell_format.horizontal_merge = aw.CellMerge.NONE
    footer_row.cells[0].paragraphs[0].runs[0].text = "Total"
    ```
	
## Exporting Tables to Different Formats

Once your table is ready, you can export it to various formats, such as PDF or DOCX:

1. Save as PDF: Save the document with the table as a PDF file.

    ```python
    doc.save("table_document.pdf", aw.SaveFormat.PDF)
    ```

2. Save as DOCX: Save the document as a DOCX file.

    ```python
    doc.save("table_document.docx", aw.SaveFormat.DOCX)
    ```
