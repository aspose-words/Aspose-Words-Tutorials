doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
builder.write('Hello world!')
pdf_file_path = 'PDF2Word.load_pdf.pdf'
doc.save(pdf_file_path)  # Save the content into a PDF file.
```

##### Step 2: Load and Display PDF Content
```python
aspose_words_doc = aw.Document(pdf_file_path)
print(aspose_words_doc.get_text().strip())
```

### Convert a PDF to .docx Format

**Overview**: Easily convert your PDF documents into the widely-used .docx format using Aspose.Words.

#### Steps:

##### Step 1: Save Content as PDF

builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
builder.write('Hello world!')
pdf_file_path = 'PDF2Word.convert_pdf_to_docx.pdf'
doc.save(pdf_file_path)
```

##### Step 2: Convert to .docx Format
```python
pdf_doc = aw.Document(pdf_file_path)
output_file_path = pdf_file_path.replace('.pdf', '.docx')
pdf_doc.save(output_file_path)
```

### Convert a PDF to .docx with Custom Save Options

**Overview**: Customize your conversion process with options like password protection.

#### Steps:

##### Step 1: Define and Apply Save Options
```python
import aspose.words as aw

doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
builder.writeln('Hello world!')
pdf_file_path = 'PDF2Word.convert_pdf_to_docx_custom.pdf'
doc.save(pdf_file_path)

# Load the document and apply custom save options
pdf_doc = aw.Document(pdf_file_path)
save_options = aw.saving.OoxmlSaveOptions(aw.SaveFormat.DOCX)
save_options.password = 'MyPassword'

output_file_path = pdf_file_path.replace('.pdf', '_custom.docx')
pdf_doc.save(output_file_path, save_options)
```

### Load a PDF using Pdf2Word Plugin

**Overview**: Utilize the Pdf2Word plugin to enhance loading capabilities for PDF documents.

#### Steps:

##### Step 1: Prepare and Save Initial Content
