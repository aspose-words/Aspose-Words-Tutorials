# Apply Aspose.Words License
license = aw.License()
license.set_license("path/to/your/license.lic")
```

## Implementation Guide

### Limiting Headings' Level in XPS Outline (Feature 1)

#### Overview

This feature helps you control the depth of headings included in an XPS document's outline, ensuring that only relevant sections are highlighted for navigation purposes.

#### Setup and Code Snippet

```python
import aspose.words as aw

class LimitedHeadingsXps:
    def __init__(self):
        self.doc = aw.Document()
        self.builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=self.doc)
        
    def setup_headings(self):
        # Insert headings to serve as TOC entries of levels 1, 2, and 3
        self.builder.paragraph_format.style_identifier = aw.StyleIdentifier.HEADING1
        self.builder.writeln('Heading 1')
        self.builder.paragraph_format.style_identifier = aw.StyleIdentifier.HEADING2
        self.builder.writeln('Heading 1.1')
        self.builder.writeln('Heading 1.2')
        self.builder.paragraph_format.style_identifier = aw.StyleIdentifier.HEADING3
        self.builder.writeln('Heading 1.2.1')
        self.builder.writeln('Heading 1.2.2')
    
    def save_with_limited_outline(self, output_path):
        # Create XpsSaveOptions to modify the document's conversion to .XPS
        save_options = aw.saving.XpsSaveOptions()
        save_options.outline_options.headings_outline_levels = 2  # Limit to level 2 headings
        self.doc.save(file_name=output_path + 'LimitedHeadingsOutline.xps', save_options=save_options)

# Usage example:
xps_save = LimitedHeadingsXps()
xps_save.setup_headings()
xps_save.save_with_limited_outline('YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/')
```

#### Explanation

- **`setup_headings()`**: This method uses the `DocumentBuilder` to insert headings of various levels into the document.
- **`save_with_limited_outline(output_path)`**: Here, we configure `XpsSaveOptions` to limit the outline levels to 2. This ensures that only headings up to level 2 are included in the XPS document's navigation pane.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your Python environment is correctly set up with Aspose.Words installed.
- Check file paths and directory permissions if you encounter save errors.

### Signing XPS Document with Digital Signature (Feature 2)

#### Overview

Digitally signing documents ensures their authenticity, providing a layer of security crucial for sensitive information. This feature allows you to apply digital signatures when saving documents in the XPS format.

#### Setup and Code Snippet

```python
import aspose.words as aw
import datetime

class SignedXpsDocument:
    def __init__(self, input_path):
        self.doc = aw.Document(file_name=input_path)
        
    def sign_document(self, certificate_path, password, output_path):
        # Create digital signature details
        certificate_holder = aw.digitalsignatures.CertificateHolder.create(
            file_name=certificate_path, password=password)
        options = aw.digitalsignatures.SignOptions()
        options.sign_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        options.comments = 'Some comments'
        
        digital_signature_details = aw.saving.DigitalSignatureDetails(certificate_holder, options)
        save_options = aw.saving.XpsSaveOptions()
        save_options.digital_signature_details = digital_signature_details
        
        # Save the signed document as XPS
        self.doc.save(file_name=output_path + 'SignedXpsDocument.xps', save_options=save_options)

# Usage example:
signed_xps = SignedXpsDocument('YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Document.docx')
signed_xps.sign_document('YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/morzal.pfx', 'aw', 'YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/')
```

#### Explanation

- **`sign_document(certificate_path, password, output_path)`**: This method sets up the digital signature using a specified certificate and saves the signed document.
- **`CertificateHolder.create()`**: Initializes the certificate holder with your digital certificate file.
- **`SignOptions()`**: Configures signature details like signing time and comments.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure that the digital certificate is valid and accessible.
- Verify password accuracy for accessing the certificate file.

## Practical Applications

1. **Corporate Document Security**: Use digital signatures to authenticate official documents, ensuring they haven't been tampered with.
2. **Legal Documentation**: Apply heading limits in legal contracts to emphasize key sections without overwhelming readers.
3. **Publishing Industry**: Streamline manuscript preparation by controlling document structure and securing drafts.

## Performance Considerations

When working with Aspose.Words for Python, consider the following tips:

- Optimize memory usage by disposing of documents after processing.
- Utilize `optimize_output` settings in `XpsSaveOptions` to reduce file sizes when saving large documents.

## Conclusion

By implementing these features using Aspose.Words for Python, you can enhance document management processes significantly. Whether it's limiting headings' levels for better navigation or securing documents with digital signatures, these tools empower you to maintain control and integrity over your data.
