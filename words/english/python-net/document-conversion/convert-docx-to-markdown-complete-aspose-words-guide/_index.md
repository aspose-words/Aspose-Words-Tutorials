# Convert docx to markdown – Complete Aspose.Words Guide

Ever wondered how to **convert docx to markdown** without losing image quality? You're not the only one. Whether you're migrating a knowledge base or exporting reports, getting clean markdown out of a Word file is a common pain point. The good news? With a few lines of Python and Aspose.Words you can **save Word as markdown** and even control the image DPI—yes, you can **set image resolution 300 dpi** for crisp embedded pictures.

In this tutorial we'll walk through the entire process, from loading a `.docx` file to configuring the markdown save options and finally writing the `.md` file. By the end you'll have a ready‑to‑use script, understand why each setting matters, and know how to tweak it for edge cases like high‑resolution graphics or large documents.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have:

- Python 3.8+ installed (the code works on any recent version).
- An active Aspose.Words for Python license or a free trial (download from the Aspose website).
- A `.docx` file you want to transform.  
- Basic familiarity with Python scripts—no deep‑learning required.

> **Pro tip:** If you’re using a virtual environment, activate it first to keep dependencies tidy.

## Step 1: Install Aspose.Words for Python

First things first—install the library via `pip`. This one‑liner gets you the latest package.

```bash
pip install aspose-words
```

Running the command will pull in all required binaries, so you won’t have to hunt down native DLLs manually. If you hit permission errors, prepend `sudo` (Linux/macOS) or run the prompt as Administrator (Windows).

## Step 2: Load the source document

Now that the SDK is ready, let’s load the Word file. Think of this as opening a notebook; Aspose.Words gives you a `Document` object that represents the whole file.

```python
import aspose.words as aw

# Step 2: Load the source document
doc = aw.Document("YOUR_DIRECTORY/input.docx")
```

> **Why this matters:** Loading the document creates an in‑memory model that preserves all elements—text, tables, images, and even hidden metadata. Without this step the conversion pipeline has nothing to work on.

## Step 3: Create Markdown save options

Aspose.Words ships with a `MarkdownSaveOptions` class that lets you fine‑tune the output. Here’s where we’ll address the **how to set image dpi** requirement.

```python
# Step 3: Create Markdown save options
md_opts = aw.saving.MarkdownSaveOptions()
```

At this point `md_opts` holds default values: images are extracted as PNGs at 96 DPI, and hyperlinks are preserved. We’re about to change that.

## Step 4: Set the image resolution for embedded images (300 DPI)

The image resolution controls how large the exported images will be. If you need **set image resolution markdown** to 300 DPI—perfect for print‑ready assets—just tweak the `image_resolution` property.

```python
# Step 4: Set the image resolution for embedded images (300 DPI)
md_opts.image_resolution = 300  # DPI
```

> **What the DPI does:** DPI (dots per inch) determines the pixel dimensions of each extracted image. A 2 in × 2 in picture at 300 DPI becomes 600 × 600 px, whereas the default 96 DPI would only yield 192 × 192 px. Higher DPI = sharper images, but also larger markdown files.

### Edge case: Large images blowing up file size

If you’re converting a document with dozens of high‑resolution photos, the resulting `.md` folder can balloon quickly. In such cases you might set a lower DPI for non‑essential images:

```python
md_opts.image_resolution = 150  # compromise between quality and size
```

Or you could post‑process the images with an external optimizer like `pngquant`.

## Step 5: Save the document as Markdown using the configured options

Finally, we write the markdown file. The `save` method takes the target path and the options we just configured.

```python
# Step 5: Save the document as Markdown using the configured options
doc.save("YOUR_DIRECTORY/output.md", md_opts)
```

When the script finishes, you’ll find `output.md` alongside an `output_files` folder containing all extracted images at the DPI you specified.

### Expected output

- `output.md` – the markdown representation of your original Word content.
- `output_files/` – a sub‑directory with image files named like `image_0.png`, `image_1.png`, etc., each rendered at 300 DPI.

Open the markdown file in any editor (VS Code, Typora, GitHub preview) and you should see image links such as:

```markdown
![image_0](output_files/image_0.png)
```

The images will appear crisp when rendered, confirming that the **set image resolution 300 dpi** step worked as intended.

## Step 6: Verify the conversion and troubleshoot common issues

### Verify image dimensions

A quick sanity check is to inspect one of the exported PNGs:

```bash
identify output_files/image_0.png
```

If you have ImageMagick installed, the command will print something like:

```
image_0.png PNG 600x600 600x600+0+0 8-bit sRGB 120KB 0.000u 0:00.000
```

Notice the `600x600` pixels—exactly 2 in × 2 in at 300 DPI.

### Common pitfalls

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Images missing in markdown | `md_opts.export_images` set to `False` (default is `True`) | Ensure you haven’t overridden this flag. |
| Markdown file empty | Document failed to load (wrong path) | Double‑check `input.docx` location and permissions. |
| Image quality still low | DPI set after saving, or image already low‑res in source | Set `image_resolution` **before** calling `save`; consider replacing low‑res source images. |

## Step 7: Automate the workflow for multiple files (Bonus)

If you have a folder full of Word docs, wrap the logic in a loop:

```python
import os
import aspose.words as aw

def convert_folder(src_dir, dst_dir, dpi=300):
    os.makedirs(dst_dir, exist_ok=True)
    for filename in os.listdir(src_dir):
        if filename.lower().endswith(".docx"):
            doc_path = os.path.join(src_dir, filename)
            md_name = os.path.splitext(filename)[0] + ".md"
            md_path = os.path.join(dst_dir, md_name)

            doc = aw.Document(doc_path)
            opts = aw.saving.MarkdownSaveOptions()
            opts.image_resolution = dpi
            doc.save(md_path, opts)
            print(f"✅ Converted {filename} → {md_name}")

# Example usage
convert_folder("YOUR_DIRECTORY/docx_batch", "YOUR_DIRECTORY/markdown_batch")
```

Now you can **save word as markdown** in bulk, each with the same 300 DPI image resolution. Perfect for CI pipelines or nightly documentation builds.

## Conclusion

You’ve just learned how to **convert docx to markdown** using Aspose.Words for Python, while mastering the **how to set image dpi** part of the puzzle. By creating `MarkdownSaveOptions`, adjusting `image_resolution`, and calling `doc.save`, you get clean, high‑resolution markdown ready for static site generators, GitHub README files, or any downstream workflow.

To recap in a single line: load the `.docx`, configure `MarkdownSaveOptions` (especially `image_resolution = 300`), and save—simple, yet powerful. Next, you might explore other options like `export_images_as_base64` or customizing heading styles, which are covered in Aspose’s documentation.

Ready to take it further? Try converting tables, preserving footnotes, or integrating the script into a Flask API that serves markdown on demand. The sky’s the limit, and with **save word as markdown** under your belt you’ve got a solid foundation.
