- Apply XML-DSig standards for signing

Let's dive into setting up your environment and get started with mastering digital signatures in Python.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites ready:

- **Python Environment**: Python 3.x installed on your system.
- **Aspose.Words for Python**: Install via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install aspose-words
  ```
- **License**: Consider obtaining a temporary license or purchasing one to unlock full features. Visit [Aspose License Purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) for more details.

Additionally, having some familiarity with working in Python and handling files will be beneficial.

## Setting Up Aspose.Words for Python

### Installation

Begin by installing the Aspose.Words library using pip:

```bash
pip install aspose-words
```

### License Acquisition

To unlock all features, acquire a license. You can start with a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/words/python/) or purchase a license for more extended use.

#### Basic Initialization

After installation and acquiring the license, you can initialize Aspose.Words in your Python script:

```python
import aspose.words as aw

# Apply license if available
license = aw.License()
license.set_license('path_to_your_license.lic')
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down each feature step-by-step to help you understand how to implement digital signatures effectively.

### Load Digital Signatures from a Document (H2)

**Overview**: This functionality allows you to extract and view digital signatures embedded in your documents, ensuring their authenticity.

#### Loading Digital Signatures Using File Path (H3)

Here's how to load signatures from a file:

```python
import aspose.words as aw

def load_signatures_from_file(file_path):
    """
    Loads digital signatures from the specified document.
    """
    digital_signatures = aw.digitalsignatures.DigitalSignatureUtil.load_signatures(file_name=file_path)
    return digital_signatures

# Example usage
signatures = load_signatures_from_file('path_to_your_document.docx')
print(signatures)
```

**Explanation**: The function `load_signatures_from_file` reads digital signatures from the document specified by `file_path`. It uses Aspose.Words' utility to retrieve and display these signatures.

#### Loading Digital Signatures Using a Stream (H3)

For scenarios where documents are handled in-memory, use file streams:

```python
import aspose.words as aw
from io import BytesIO

def load_signatures_from_stream(stream):
    """
    Loads digital signatures from the provided stream.
    """
    with aw.FileStream(stream, aw.FileMode.OPEN) as fs_stream:
        digital_signatures = aw.digitalsignatures.DigitalSignatureUtil.load_signatures(stream=fs_stream)
    return digital_signatures

# Example usage
stream = BytesIO(b'Your document content')
signatures = load_signatures_from_stream(stream)
print(signatures)
```

**Explanation**: This approach uses a `BytesIO` stream to read and process the document's signatures, which is useful for applications dealing with in-memory data.

### Remove Digital Signatures from a Document (H2)

**Overview**: Removing digital signatures can be necessary when updating or re-authorizing documents. Aspose.Words makes this process straightforward.

#### Removing Signatures by Filename (H3)

Here's the code to remove all signatures from a document:

```python
import aspose.words as aw

def remove_signatures_by_filename(src_file_name, dst_file_name):
    """
    Removes digital signatures and saves an unsigned copy.
    """
    aw.digitalsignatures.DigitalSignatureUtil.remove_all_signatures(
        src_file_name=src_file_name,
        dst_file_name=dst_file_name
    )

# Example usage
remove_signatures_by_filename('source.docx', 'unsigned_document.docx')
```

**Explanation**: This function takes the path of a signed document and removes all embedded signatures, saving an unsigned version as specified.

#### Removing Signatures by Stream (H3)

To handle documents in-memory:

```python
import aspose.words as aw
from io import BytesIO

def remove_signatures_by_stream(src_stream, dst_stream):
    """
    Removes digital signatures from the document streams.
    """
    with aw.FileStream(src_stream, aw.FileMode.OPEN) as fs_src_stream:
        with aw.FileStream(dst_stream, aw.FileMode.CREATE) as fs_dst_stream:
            aw.digitalsignatures.DigitalSignatureUtil.remove_all_signatures(
                src_stream=fs_src_stream,
                dst_stream=fs_dst_stream
            )

# Example usage
src = BytesIO(b'Signed document content')
dst = BytesIO()
remove_signatures_by_stream(src, dst)
```

**Explanation**: This function works with file streams to remove digital signatures directly from in-memory documents.

### Sign Document (H2)

Signing a document provides assurance of its authenticity. We'll explore how to digitally sign both regular and encrypted documents.

#### Digitally Signing a Regular Document (H3)

```python
import aspose.words as aw
from io import BytesIO
import datetime

def sign_document(src_file_name, dst_file_name, pfx_file_name, pfx_password):
    """
    Signs the document using an X.509 certificate.
    """
    certificate_holder = aw.digitalsignatures.CertificateHolder.create(
        file_name=pfx_file_name,
        password=pfx_password
    )
    
    sign_options = aw.digitalsignatures.SignOptions()
    sign_options.comments = 'My comment'
    sign_options.sign_time = datetime.datetime.now()

    with aw.FileStream(src_file_name, aw.FileMode.OPEN) as stream_in:
        with aw.FileStream(dst_file_name, aw.FileMode.OPEN_OR_CREATE) as stream_out:
            aw.digitalsignatures.DigitalSignatureUtil.sign(
                src_stream=stream_in,
                dst_stream=stream_out,
                cert_holder=certificate_holder,
                sign_options=sign_options
            )

# Example usage
sign_document('document.docx', 'signed_document.docx', 'morzal.pfx', 'aw')
```

**Explanation**: This function signs a document with an X.509 certificate, adding a timestamp and optional comments for clarity.

#### Digitally Signing an Encrypted Document (H3)

For encrypted documents:

```python
import aspose.words as aw
from io import BytesIO
import datetime

def sign_encrypted_document(src_file_name, dst_file_name, pfx_file_name, pfx_password, doc_password):
    """
    Signs an encrypted document with a certificate.
    """
    certificate_holder = aw.digitalsignatures.CertificateHolder.create(
        file_name=pfx_file_name,
        password=pfx_password
    )
    
    doc = aw.Document(src_file_name, load_options=aw.loading.LoadOptions(password=doc_password))
    
    sign_options = aw.digitalsignatures.SignOptions()
    sign_options.comments = 'Comment'
    sign_options.sign_time = datetime.datetime.now()
    sign_options.decryption_password = doc_password

    aw.digitalsignatures.DigitalSignatureUtil.sign(
        src_file_name=doc.original_file_name,
        dst_file_name=dst_file_name,
        cert_holder=certificate_holder,
        sign_options=sign_options
    )

# Example usage
sign_encrypted_document('encrypted.docx', 'signed_encrypted.docx', 'morzal.pfx', 'aw', 'password')
```

**Explanation**: This function handles encrypted documents by decrypting them before signing, ensuring secure handling throughout the process.

### Sign Documents Using XML-DSig (H2)

**Overview**: Adhering to XML-DSig standards provides a standardized method for signing digital documents, enhancing interoperability and compliance.

```python
import aspose.words as aw
from io import BytesIO
import datetime

def sign_with_xml_dsig(src_file_name, dst_file_name, pfx_file_name, pfx_password):
    """
    Signs the document using XML-DSig standards.
    """
    certificate_holder = aw.digitalsignatures.CertificateHolder.create(
        file_name=pfx_file_name,
        password=pfx_password
    )
    
    sign_options = aw.digitalsignatures.SignOptions()
    sign_options.comments = 'XML-DSig signed'
    sign_options.sign_time = datetime.datetime.now()

    with aw.FileStream(src_file_name, aw.FileMode.OPEN) as stream_in:
        with aw.FileStream(dst_file_name, aw.FileMode.OPEN_OR_CREATE) as stream_out:
            aw.digitalsignatures.DigitalSignatureUtil.sign(
                src_stream=stream_in,
                dst_stream=stream_out,
                cert_holder=certificate_holder,
                sign_options=sign_options
            )

# Example usage
sign_with_xml_dsig('document.docx', 'xml_signed_document.docx', 'morzal.pfx', 'aw')
```

**Explanation**: This function signs a document following XML-DSig standards, ensuring it meets industry compliance for digital signatures.
