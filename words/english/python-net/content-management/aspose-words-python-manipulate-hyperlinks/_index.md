# Initialize the Aspose.Words license
license = aw.License()
license.set_license("Aspose.Words.Python.lic")
```

With this setup complete, let's move on to implementing our features.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Selecting Nodes

#### Overview

Our first task is to select all field start nodes in a Word document. This involves using an XPath expression to locate these nodes efficiently.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Step 1: Define the DocumentFieldSelector Class

Create a class that initializes with a document path and includes a method to select fields:

```python
import aspose.words as aw

class DocumentFieldSelector:
    def __init__(self, document_path: str):
        self.doc = aw.Document(document_path)

    def select_fields(self) -> list:
        """
        Selects all field start nodes in the document using XPath.
        Returns a list of FieldStart nodes.
        """
        # Use XPath to find all FieldStart nodes
        return self.doc.select_nodes("//FieldStart")
```

##### Step 2: Utilize the Class

Use the class to select and print the number of fields:

```python
document_path = 'YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Hyperlinks.docx'
selector = DocumentFieldSelector(document_path)
fields = selector.select_fields()
print(f'Found {len(fields)} field starts.')
```

### Feature 2: Hyperlink Manipulation

#### Overview

Next, we’ll manipulate hyperlinks within the Word document. This involves identifying hyperlink fields and updating their targets.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Step 1: Define the HyperlinkManipulator Class

Create a class that initializes with a field start node of type `FIELD_HYPERLINK`:

```python
import aspose.words as aw
import re

class HyperlinkManipulator:
    def __init__(self, field_start: aw.fields.FieldStart):
        if field_start is None or field_start.field_type != aw.fields.FieldType.FIELD_HYPERLINK:
            raise ValueError("Field start must be of type FieldHyperlink.")
        
        self.field_start = field_start
        self._initialize_hyperlink()

    def _initialize_hyperlink(self):
        """
        Initializes the HyperlinkManipulator by setting up necessary nodes and extracting hyperlink target.
        """
        # Find and set the field separator node
        self.field_separator = self.find_next_sibling(self.field_start, aw.NodeType.FIELD_SEPARATOR)
        if not self.field_separator:
            raise Exception("Cannot find field separator.")
        
        # Optionally find the field end node
        self.field_end = self.find_next_sibling(self.field_separator, aw.NodeType.FIELD_END)
        
        # Extract and parse the field code text between field start and separator
        field_code_text = self.get_text_same_parent(self.field_start.next_sibling, self.field_separator)
        pattern = r"\S+\s+(?:""\s+)?(\\l\s+)?"([^"]+)"
        match = re.match(pattern, field_code_text.strip())
        
        # Determine if the hyperlink is local (bookmark) and set its target URL or bookmark name
        self._is_local = bool(match.group(1))
        self._target = match.group(2)

    @property
    def target(self) -> str:
        return self._target

    @target.setter
    def target(self, value: str):
        """
        Sets the hyperlink's target URL or bookmark name and updates field code.
        """
        self._target = value
        self.update_field_code()

    def update_field_code(self):
        """
        Updates the field code text based on whether it is a local link (bookmark) or external URL.
        """
        # Locate and modify the run node containing the field code
        field_code_run = self.field_start.next_sibling.as_run()
        field_code_run.text = f'HYPERLINK {"\\l " if self._is_local else ""}"{self._target}'
        
        # Remove any additional runs between field start and separator, which are not needed
        self.remove_same_parent(field_code_run.next_sibling, self.field_separator)

    @staticmethod
    def find_next_sibling(start_node: aw.Node, node_type: aw.NodeType) -> aw.Node:
        """
        Traverses siblings from the start node to find a specific node type or returns None.
        """
        current = start_node
        while current is not None:
            if current.node_type == node_type:
                return current
            current = current.next_sibling
        return None

    @staticmethod
    def get_text_same_parent(start_node: aw.Node, end_node: aw.Node) -> str:
        """
        Collects text from start node up to but not including the end node.
        Assumes both nodes share the same parent.
        """
        if end_node and start_node.parent_node != end_node.parent_node:
            raise ValueError("Start and end nodes must have the same parent.")
        
        text = ''
        child = start_node
        while child and child != end_node:
            text += child.get_text()
            child = child.next_sibling
        return text

    @staticmethod
    def remove_same_parent(start_node: aw.Node, end_node: aw.Node):
        """
        Removes nodes from the start node up to but not including the end node.
        Assumes both nodes share the same parent.
        """
        if end_node and start_node.parent_node != end_node.parent_node:
            raise ValueError("Start and end nodes must have the same parent.")
        
        current = start_node
        while current and current != end_node:
            next_node = current.next_sibling
            current.remove()
            current = next_node
```

##### Step 2: Utilize the Class

Use the class to manipulate hyperlinks in your document:

```python
document_path = 'YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Hyperlinks.docx'
doc = aw.Document(document_path)
field_starts = doc.select_nodes("//FieldStart")
for field_start in field_starts:
    if field_start.field_type == aw.fields.FieldType.FIELD_HYPERLINK:
        hyperlink = HyperlinkManipulator(field_start)
        hyperlink.target = "http://www.aspose.com"

# Save the document after modifications
doc.save('YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ModifiedHyperlinks.docx')
```
