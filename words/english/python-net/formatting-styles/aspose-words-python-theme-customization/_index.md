### Custom Colors and Fonts

#### Overview
This section focuses on modifying the default theme colors and fonts of a Word document. These changes affect styles like "Heading 1" and "Subtitle," ensuring they align with your brand’s design guidelines.

#### Steps to Customize Theme Colors

1. **Access Document Themes:**
   Load your document and access its theme:

```python
doc = aw.Document(file_name='YourFile.docx')
theme = doc.theme
```

2. **Customize Major Fonts:**
   Change major fonts to suit your preferences, such as setting "Courier New" for Latin scripts.

theme.major_fonts.latin = 'Courier New'
```

3. **Set Minor Fonts:**
   Similarly, adjust minor fonts like 'Agency FB' for specific styles:
