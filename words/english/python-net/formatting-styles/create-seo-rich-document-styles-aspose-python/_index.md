## Implementation Guide
### Creating Custom Styles
#### Overview
Custom styles ensure consistent formatting across your document effortlessly. This section guides you through creating a new style from scratch.
#### Step 1: Define the Style
Start by defining your custom style's properties, such as name, font attributes, paragraph spacing, borders, etc.
```python
# Create a new style in the document's styles collection
doc.styles.add(aw.StyleType.PARAGRAPH, "SEOStyle")
# Set font characteristics
font = doc.styles["SEOStyle"].font
font.name = "Arial"
font.size = 14
font.bold = True
# Configure paragraph formatting
paragraph_format = doc.styles["SEOStyle"].paragraph_format
paragraph_format.space_before = 10
paragraph_format.space_after = 10
```
#### Step 2: Apply the Style to Text
Apply your custom style to a specific part of the document.
```python
# Move to the end of the document and add some text with the new style
doc_builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
doc_builder.move_to_document_end()
doc_builder.write("This is a paragraph styled with SEOStyle.")
# Apply the custom style
doc_builder.current_paragraph.applied_style = doc.styles["SEOStyle"]
```
#### Step 3: Save Your Document
After applying styles, save your document to retain changes.
```python
# Save the document
doc.save("StyledDocument.docx")
```
