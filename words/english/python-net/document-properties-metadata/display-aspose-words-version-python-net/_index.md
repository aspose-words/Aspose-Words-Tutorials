**What You’ll Learn:**
- Installing Aspose.Words for Python via .NET
- Retrieving and displaying product version information
- Practical applications in real-world scenarios

Let’s cover the prerequisites first!

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies:
- **Aspose.Words for Python via .NET** installed. Installation steps follow.
- Basic understanding of Python programming.

### Environment Setup Requirements:
- A development environment with Python (preferably version 3.x) installed.
- Access to a command-line interface for installing packages using `pip`.

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Familiarity with Python syntax and basic command-line operations is recommended. Understanding .NET interoperability in Python projects can be helpful but isn't mandatory.

## Setting Up Aspose.Words for Python
To work with Aspose.Words, you need to install it first using `pip`.

### pip Installation:
Open your command-line interface and execute the following command:
