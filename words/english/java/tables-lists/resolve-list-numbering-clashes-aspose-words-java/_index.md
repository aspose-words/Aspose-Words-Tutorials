# Resolve List Numbering Clashes with Aspose.Words for Java

## Introduction

Merging documents can be complex, especially when dealing with custom list numbering that conflicts. Using Aspose.Words for Java, you can smoothly integrate documents while preserving or adjusting their original numbering formats. This tutorial will guide you through resolving list numbering clashes using Aspose.Words Java.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to use the `ImportFormatOptions` class with the `KeepSourceNumbering` option.
- Techniques to maintain or merge custom list numbering during document import.
- Implementing solutions for inserting documents at bookmarks and merge fields.

Let's explore how you can leverage Aspose.Words Java to handle these challenges effectively. Before diving in, ensure you have all necessary prerequisites covered.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following:
- **Libraries**: You need Aspose.Words for Java version 25.3 or later.
- **Development Environment**: Any IDE that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- **Java Knowledge**: Basic understanding of Java programming and document handling concepts.

## Setting Up Aspose.Words

To start using Aspose.Words for Java, you'll first need to add it as a dependency in your project. Depending on your build tool, here's how:

### Maven
Add the following to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-words</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
Include this line in your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-words:25.3'
```

### Basic Initialization
Hereâ€™s how you can initialize the library in your Java application:
```java
Document doc = new Document();
// Your code here
```

## Implementation Guide

This section covers resolving list numbering clashes and other document manipulation techniques using Aspose.Words for Java.

### Resolving List Numbering Clashes

#### Overview
When merging documents with identical custom list formats, number clashes can occur. This feature lets you choose whether to keep the original numbering or merge them into a continuous sequence.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Set Up Your Documents**
   Clone your source document for manipulation.
   ```java
   Document srcDoc = new Document("Custom list numbering.docx");
   Document dstDoc = srcDoc.deepClone();
   ```

2. **Configure Import Options**
   Use `ImportFormatOptions` to manage how the documents are combined.
   ```java
   ImportFormatOptions importFormatOptions = new ImportFormatOptions();
   importFormatOptions.setKeepSourceNumbering(true); // or false for merging numbering
   ```

3. **Node Importer Setup**
   Utilize `NodeImporter` to handle node-level operations while importing the document.
   ```java
   NodeImporter importer = new NodeImporter(srcDoc, dstDoc, ImportFormatMode.KEEP_DIFFERENT_STYLES, importFormatOptions);
   ```

4. **Import and Append Nodes**
   Iterate through paragraphs in the source document and append them to the destination.
   ```java
   for (Paragraph paragraph : srcDoc.getFirstSection().getBody().getParagraphs()) {
       Node importedNode = importer.importNode(paragraph, true);
       dstDoc.getFirstSection().getBody().appendChild(importedNode);
   }
   ```

5. **Update List Labels**
   Ensure the document's list labels are updated to reflect the chosen numbering strategy.
   ```java
   dstDoc.updateListLabels();
   ```

### Practical Applications

- **Merging Reports**: Combine multiple sections of reports with distinct numbering without losing context.
- **Document Consolidation**: Create a master document from various chapters while preserving their original formatting and list structures.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large documents or numerous merges, consider the following:

- **Memory Management**: Ensure your system has adequate memory allocated for processing large files.
- **Batch Processing**: For multiple document operations, process them in batches to manage resource usage effectively.

## Conclusion

By mastering Aspose.Words Java's features like `ImportFormatOptions` and `NodeImporter`, you can efficiently resolve list numbering clashes during document merges. This not only enhances the accuracy of your documents but also saves time when integrating content from multiple sources.

**Next Steps**: Explore more advanced features of Aspose.Words, such as handling complex formatting or integrating with other APIs to automate document processing workflows.
