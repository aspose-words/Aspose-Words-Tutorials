# Save Document as PDF – Complete Aspose.Words Guide

Ever needed to **save document as PDF** but weren’t sure which API call to use? You’re not alone. Many developers stare at a Word file and wonder how to get a clean PDF without fiddling with third‑party tools. The good news? With Aspose.Words for Java you can **convert docx to pdf** in a single method call, and you even get fine‑grained control over how floating shapes are rendered.

In this tutorial we’ll walk through a real‑world example that shows exactly how to **save document as PDF**, why you might choose the *INLINE* versus *BLOCK* export mode, and what to do when you need to **convert word to pdf** in a batch job. By the end you’ll have a ready‑to‑run Java program that **save word as pdf** with just a few lines of code.

## What You’ll Learn

- How to load a DOCX file with Aspose.Words.
- How to configure `PdfSaveOptions` to control shape export.
- How to **save document as PDF** (or **convert docx to pdf**) on disk.
- Common pitfalls when **convert word to pdf**, such as missing fonts or large images.
- Tips for scaling this approach to a production‑grade **aspose convert docx pdf** pipeline.

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or newer (the code works with JDK 8+ as well).
- Aspose.Words for Java library (version 23.12 or later). You can grab it from Maven Central:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-words</artifactId>
    <version>23.12</version>
</dependency>
```

- A DOCX file you want to transform – any Word document will do.

> **Pro tip:** If you’re using a build tool other than Maven, just add the corresponding JAR to your classpath.

Now, let’s dive in.

## Step 1: Load the Source Document

The first thing you do when you **convert docx to pdf** is to read the source file into an Aspose `Document` object. This object represents the entire Word file in memory, giving you access to paragraphs, tables, images, and even custom XML parts.

```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;

public class DocxToPdfDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Step 1: Load the source document (your .docx file)
        Document doc = new Document("YOUR_DIRECTORY/input.docx");
        // From here on you can manipulate the document if needed
```

> **Why this matters:** Loading the document isolates you from the underlying file format. Whether the source is `.docx`, `.doc`, or even an OpenDocument file, Aspose.Words normalizes it into a single object model, making the later **save word as pdf** step predictable.

## Step 2: Configure PDF Save Options (Control Floating Shapes)

When you **save document as pdf**, Aspose.Words uses default settings that work for most scenarios. However, if your Word file contains floating shapes—text boxes, SmartArt, or images anchored to a paragraph—you might want to decide whether they appear *inline* (as part of the text flow) or *block* (preserving their original layout). This is where `PdfSaveOptions` shines.

```java
import com.aspose.words.PdfSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.words.ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag;

        // Step 2: Create PDF save options and choose shape export mode
        PdfSaveOptions pdfOpts = new PdfSaveOptions();

        // Choose INLINE to flatten shapes into the text flow (good for simple PDFs)
        // or BLOCK to keep the original layout (better fidelity for complex docs)
        pdfOpts.setExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag(ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag.INLINE);
        // Uncomment the line below to use BLOCK instead
        // pdfOpts.setExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag(ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag.BLOCK);
```

> **When to use BLOCK:** If your Word document contains a floating chart that must stay exactly where the author placed it, BLOCK preserves that positioning.  
> **When to use INLINE:** For contracts or simple reports where you want a linear flow, INLINE often reduces file size and improves compatibility with older PDF viewers.

## Step 3: Save the Document as PDF

Now comes the moment of truth: actually **save document as PDF**. The `save` method takes the output path and the options we just configured.

```java
        // Step 3: Save the document as PDF using the configured options
        doc.save("YOUR_DIRECTORY/inlineShapes.pdf", pdfOpts);
        System.out.println("PDF generated successfully!");
    }
}
```

Running the program will produce `inlineShapes.pdf` in the same folder. Open it with any PDF reader, and you’ll see that floating shapes have been rendered according to the mode you selected.

### Expected Output

```
PDF generated successfully!
```

And opening `inlineShapes.pdf` should show a faithful representation of `input.docx`, with floating shapes either merged into the text (INLINE) or kept in their original positions (BLOCK).

## Handling Common Edge Cases

### Missing Fonts

If the source DOCX uses a font that isn’t installed on the server, Aspose.Words substitutes it with a default font, which can alter the visual layout. To avoid surprises, embed fonts during the PDF conversion:

```java
pdfOpts.setEmbedFullFonts(true);
```

### Large Images

Huge raster images can bloat the resulting PDF. You can downscale them on the fly:

```java
pdfOpts.setImageCompressionLevel(100); // 0 = max compression, 100 = no compression
```

Adjust the level based on your quality‑vs‑size requirements.

### Batch Conversion (Multiple Files)

If you need to **convert word to pdf** for dozens of files, wrap the logic in a loop:

```java
File folder = new File("YOUR_DIRECTORY");
for (File file : folder.listFiles((dir, name) -> name.endsWith(".docx"))) {
    Document doc = new Document(file.getAbsolutePath());
    doc.save(file.getName().replace(".docx", ".pdf"), pdfOpts);
}
```

That snippet turns a whole folder of DOCX files into PDFs with a single configuration—perfect for an **aspose convert docx pdf** service.

## Full Working Example (All Steps Together)

Below is the complete, copy‑paste‑ready Java class that demonstrates the whole process from loading a DOCX to saving it as a PDF with shape export control.

```java
import com.aspose.words.*;

public class AsposeDocxToPdf {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // 1️⃣ Load the source DOCX
            Document doc = new Document("YOUR_DIRECTORY/input.docx");

            // 2️⃣ Configure PDF options (INLINE vs BLOCK)
            PdfSaveOptions pdfOpts = new PdfSaveOptions();
            pdfOpts.setExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag(ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag.INLINE);
            // Optional: embed fonts for consistent rendering
            pdfOpts.setEmbedFullFonts(true);
            // Optional: compress images to reduce size
            pdfOpts.setImageCompressionLevel(80);

            // 3️⃣ Save as PDF
            String outputPath = "YOUR_DIRECTORY/inlineShapes.pdf";
            doc.save(outputPath, pdfOpts);

            System.out.println("✅ PDF saved at: " + outputPath);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("❌ Conversion failed: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

> **Why this works:** The `Document` class abstracts the Word format, `PdfSaveOptions` gives you granular control, and `doc.save` performs the heavy lifting. No external tools, no temporary files—just pure Java.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I convert a `.doc` (old Word format) the same way?**  
A: Absolutely. Aspose.Words auto‑detects the format, so you can point `new Document("file.doc")` and the rest of the code stays unchanged.

A: Use `pdfOpts.setEncryptionDetails(new PdfEncryptionDetails("ownerPwd", "userPwd", PdfEncryptionAlgorithm.AES_256));`

**Q: Does this approach work on Linux servers?**  
A: Yes. Aspose.Words is platform‑agnostic; just make sure the required fonts are installed or embed them as shown above.

## Conclusion

We’ve covered everything you need to **save document as PDF** using Aspose.Words for Java. From loading a DOCX, tweaking `PdfSaveOptions` to control floating shapes, to finally writing the PDF to disk, the process is straightforward and highly customizable. You now know how to **convert docx to pdf**, **convert word to pdf**, and **save word as pdf**—all in a single, self‑contained program.

What’s next? Try swapping the INLINE mode for BLOCK, embed custom fonts, or build a REST endpoint that accepts uploaded Word files and returns PDFs on the fly. The same pattern scales to an **aspose convert docx pdf** microservice, letting you automate document workflows across your organization.
