This feature demonstrates how to add a comment and a reply within a Word document. It's ideal for collaborative document editing where multiple users can provide feedback.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1:** Initialize the Document Object
```java
Document document = new Document();
DocumentBuilder documentBuilder = new DocumentBuilder(document);
```

**Step 2:** Create and Add a Comment
```java
Comment comment = new Comment(document, "John Doe", "J.D.", new Date());
comment.setText("My comment.");
documentBuilder.getCurrentParagraph().appendChild(comment);
```

**Step 3:** Add a Reply to the Comment
```java
comment.addReply("Joe Bloggs", "J.B.", new Date(), "New reply");
document.save(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "/CommentWithReply.docx");
```

### Feature 2: Print All Comments
**Overview**
This feature prints all top-level comments and their replies, making it easy to review feedback in bulk.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1:** Load the Document
```java
Document doc = new Document(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "/Comments.docx");
```

**Step 2:** Retrieve and Print Comments
```java
NodeCollection<Comment> comments = doc.getChildNodes(NodeType.COMMENT, true);
for (Comment comment : (Iterable<Comment>) comments) {
    if (comment.getAncestor() == null) {
        System.out.println("Top-level comment:");
        System.out.println("\t" + comment.getText().trim() + ", by " + comment.getAuthor());
        for (Comment reply : comment.getReplies()) {
            System.out.println("\t" + reply.getText().trim() + ", by " + reply.getAuthor());
        }
    }
}
```

### Feature 3: Remove Comment Replies
**Overview**
Remove specific replies or all replies from a comment to keep the document clean and organized.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1:** Initialize and Add Comments with Replies
```java
Document document = new Document();
Comment comment = new Comment(document, "John Doe", "J.D.", new Date());
comment.setText("My comment.");
document.getFirstSection().getBody().getFirstParagraph().appendChild(comment);
comment.addReply("Joe Bloggs", "J.B.", new Date(), "New reply");
comment.addReply("Joe Bloggs", "J.B.", new Date(), "Another reply");
```

**Step 2:** Remove Replies
```java
comment.removeReply(comment.getReplies().get(0)); // Remove one reply
comment.removeAllReplies(); // Remove all remaining replies
```

### Feature 4: Mark Comment as Done
**Overview**
Mark comments as resolved to track issues efficiently within your document.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1:** Create a Document and Add a Comment
```java
Document document = new Document();
DocumentBuilder documentBuilder = new DocumentBuilder(document);
documentBuilder.writeln("Hello world!");
Comment comment = new Comment(document, "John Doe", "J.D.", new Date());
comment.setText("Fix the spelling error!");
```

**Step 2:** Mark the Comment as Done
```java
document.getFirstSection().getBody().getFirstParagraph().appendChild(comment);
document.getFirstSection().getBody().getFirstParagraph().getRuns().get(0).setText("Hello world!");
comment.setDone(true);
document.save(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "/CommentDone.docx");
```

### Feature 5: Get UTC Date and Time from Comment
**Overview**
Retrieve the exact UTC date and time a comment was added for precise tracking.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1:** Create a Document with a Timestamped Comment
```java
Document document = new Document();
DocumentBuilder documentBuilder = new DocumentBuilder(document);
Date dateTime = new Date();
Comment comment = new Comment(document, "John Doe", "J.D.", dateTime);
comment.setText("My comment.");
documentBuilder.getCurrentParagraph().appendChild(comment);
```

**Step 2:** Save and Retrieve the UTC Date
```java
document.save(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "/CommentUtcDateTime.docx");
Document doc = new Document(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "/CommentUtcDateTime.docx");
Comment currentComment = (Comment) doc.getChild(NodeType.COMMENT, 0, true);
assert currentComment.getDateTimeUtc().toString() == dateTime.toString();
```
