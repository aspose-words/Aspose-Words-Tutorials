## Implementation Guide

### Custom Mail Merge Data Source

#### Overview
This section demonstrates how to execute a mail merge using custom data objects by implementing the `IMailMergeDataSource` interface.

#### Step 1: Define Your Data Entity

Create a class that represents your data entity. For example, a customer with attributes for full name and address:

```java
class Customer {
    private String mFullName;
    private String mAddress;

    public Customer(String fullName, String address) {
        this.mFullName = fullName;
        this.mAddress = address;
    }

    // Getter and setter methods...
}
```

#### Step 2: Create a Typed Collection

Develop a collection to manage multiple data entities:

```java
class CustomerList extends ArrayList<Customer> {
    public Customer get(int index) { return super.get(index); }
    public void set(int index, Customer value) { super.set(index, value); }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement IMailMergeDataSource

Implement the interface to enable Aspose.Words to access your data:

```java
class CustomerMailMergeDataSource implements IMailMergeDataSource {
    private final CustomerList mCustomers;
    private int mRecordIndex = -1;

    public CustomerMailMergeDataSource(CustomerList customers) {
        this.mCustomers = customers;
    }

    @Override
    public String getTableName() { return "Customer"; }

    @Override
    public boolean getValue(String fieldName, Ref<Object> fieldValue) throws Exception {
        if (fieldName.equals("FullName")) {
            fieldValue.set(mCustomers.get(mRecordIndex).getFullName());
            return true;
        } else if (fieldName.equals("Address")) {
            fieldValue.set(mCustomers.get(mRecordIndex).getAddress());
            return true;
        }
        fieldValue.set(null);
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean moveNext() { 
        mRecordIndex++;
        return !isEof(); 
    }

    private boolean isEof() {
        return mRecordIndex >= mCustomers.size();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Execute the Mail Merge

Perform the mail merge using your custom data source:

```java
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
builder.insertField(" MERGEFIELD FullName ");
builder.insertParagraph();
builder.insertField(" MERGEFIELD Address ");

CustomerList customers = new CustomerList();
customers.add(new Customer("Thomas Hardy", "120 Hanover Sq., London"));
customers.add(new Customer("Paolo Accorti", "Via Monte Bianco 34, Torino"));

doc.getMailMerge().execute(new CustomerMailMergeDataSource(customers));
```

### Master-Detail Data Source

#### Overview
Learn how to handle more complex data structures with master-detail relationships using `IMailMergeDataSource`.

#### Step 1: Define Master and Detail Entities

For instance, an employee with a department:

```java
class Employee {
    private String name;
    private Department dept;

    // Constructor, getters...
}

class Department {
    private String name;

    // Constructor, getters...
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Data Source for Master-Detail Structure

Create classes implementing `IMailMergeDataSource` for both master and detail entities:

```java
class EmployeeMailMergeDataSource implements IMailMergeDataSource {
    private final List<Employee> employees;
    private int employeeIndex = -1;

    public EmployeeMailMergeDataSource(List<Employee> employees) {
        this.employees = employees;
    }

    @Override
    public String getTableName() { return "Employees"; }
    
    @Override
    public boolean getValue(String fieldName, Ref<Object> fieldValue) throws Exception {
        Employee emp = employees.get(employeeIndex);
        switch (fieldName) {
            case "Name":
                fieldValue.set(emp.getName());
                break;
            case "Department":
                Department dept = emp.getDept();
                fieldValue.set(dept != null ? dept.getName() : "");
                break;
            default:
                fieldValue.set(null);
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean moveNext() { 
        employeeIndex++;
        return !isEof(); 
    }

    private boolean isEof() {
        return employeeIndex >= employees.size();
    }
    
    // Implement getChildDataSource for nested data...
}
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Automated Invoicing:** Generate invoices with customer details and transaction records dynamically.
2. **Report Generation:** Create detailed reports with nested tables representing hierarchical data structures.
3. **Bulk Emailing:** Produce personalized email templates from a list of contacts.

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Processing:** When dealing with large datasets, process in batches to manage memory efficiently.
- **Optimize Queries:** Ensure that your data retrieval logic is optimized for speed.
- **Resource Management:** Close streams and release resources promptly after use.
