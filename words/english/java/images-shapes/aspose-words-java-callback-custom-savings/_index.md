    public SavedDocumentPartRename(String outFileName, int documentSplitCriteria) {
        this.mOutFileName = outFileName;
        this.mDocumentSplitCriteria = documentSplitCriteria;
    }

    public void documentPartSaving(DocumentPartSavingArgs args) throws Exception {
        String partType = determinePartType();
        String partFileName = MessageFormat.format("{0} part {1}, of type {2}.{3}", 
                                                   mOutFileName, ++mCount, partType, FilenameUtils.getExtension(args.getDocumentPartFileName()));
        
        args.setDocumentPartFileName(partFileName);

        try (FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + partFileName)) {
            args.setDocumentPartStream(outputStream);
        }

        assert args.getDocumentPartStream() != null;
        assert !args.getKeepDocumentPartStreamOpen();
    }

    private String determinePartType() {
        switch (mDocumentSplitCriteria) {
            case DocumentSplitCriteria.PAGE_BREAK: return "Page";
            case DocumentSplitCriteria.COLUMN_BREAK: return "Column";
            case DocumentSplitCriteria.SECTION_BREAK: return "Section";
            case DocumentSplitCriteria.HEADING_PARAGRAPH: return "Paragraph from heading";
            default: return "";
        }
    }
