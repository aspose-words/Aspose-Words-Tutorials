class InitializeAsposeWords {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Load your document
        Document doc = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Hyperlinks.docx");

        System.out.println("Document loaded successfully!");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's explore how to implement hyperlink management in Word documents.

### Feature 1: Select Hyperlinks from a Document

**Overview**: Extract all hyperlinks from your Word document using Aspose.Words Java. Utilize XPath to identify `FieldStart` nodes that indicate potential hyperlinks.

#### Step 1: Load the Document
Ensure you specify the correct path for your document:
```java
Document doc = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Hyperlinks.docx");
```

#### Step 2: Select Hyperlink Nodes
Use XPath to find `FieldStart` nodes representing hyperlink fields in Word documents:
```java
NodeList fieldStarts = doc.selectNodes("//FieldStart");
for (FieldStart fieldStart : (Iterable<FieldStart>) fieldStarts) {
    if (fieldStart.getFieldType() == FieldType.FIELD_HYPERLINK) {
        Hyperlink hyperlink = new Hyperlink(fieldStart);
        if (hyperlink.isLocal()) continue;

        // Placeholder for further manipulation
    }
}
```

### Feature 2: Hyperlink Class Implementation

**Overview**: The `Hyperlink` class encapsulates and allows you to manipulate the properties of a hyperlink within your document.

#### Step 1: Initialize Hyperlink Object
Create an instance by passing in a `FieldStart` node:
```java
Hyperlink hyperlink = new Hyperlink(fieldStart);
```

#### Step 2: Manage Hyperlink Properties
Access and adjust properties such as name, target URL, or local status:
- **Get Name**:
  ```java
  String linkName = hyperlink.getName();
  ```
- **Set New Target**:
  ```java
  hyperlink.setTarget("https://example.com");
  ```
- **Check Local Link**:
  ```java
  boolean isLocalLink = hyperlink.isLocal();
  ```

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Compliance**: Update outdated hyperlinks to ensure accuracy.
2. **SEO Optimization**: Modify link targets for better search engine visibility.
3. **Collaborative Editing**: Facilitate easy addition or modification of document links by team members.

## Performance Considerations
- **Batch Processing**: Handle large documents in batches to optimize memory usage.
- **Regular Expression Efficiency**: Fine-tune regex patterns within the `Hyperlink` class for faster execution times.
