Below you’ll find a quick start guide followed by a curated list of tutorial categories that dive deeper into each capability.

### Quick‑Start: Set Up Aspose.Words in 3 Simple Steps  

1. **Add the Maven/Gradle dependency**  
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
       <artifactId>aspose-words</artifactId>
       <version>23.12</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
   </dependency>
   ```  
2. **Apply your license** (replace `YourLicenseFile.lic` with the actual path)  
   ```java
   com.aspose.words.License license = new com.aspose.words.License();
   license.setLicense("YourLicenseFile.lic");
   ```  
3. **Run a sample conversion** – convert a DOCX to PDF in one line  
   ```java
   Document doc = new Document("sample.docx");
   doc.save("sample.pdf", SaveFormat.PDF);
   ```  

> **Tip:** The `Document` class is the core object for all operations – creating, editing, merging, watermarking, and protecting Word files.
