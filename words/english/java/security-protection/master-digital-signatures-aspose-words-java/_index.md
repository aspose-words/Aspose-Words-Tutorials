```

## Implementation Guide

This section is divided into logical steps for each feature you’ll implement.

### Load Signatures from a File

#### Overview

Loading digital signatures from files ensures that the documents haven’t been altered since they were signed. This step verifies if a document is digitally signed and helps maintain its integrity.

**Step 1: Import Required Classes**

```java
import com.aspose.words.DigitalSignatureCollection;
import com.aspose.words.DigitalSignatureUtil;
```

**Step 2: Load Signatures from the File Path**

```java
DigitalSignatureCollection digitalSignatures =
        DigitalSignatureUtil.loadSignatures("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Digitally signed.docx");

if (digitalSignatures.getCount() > 0) {
    System.out.println("Document is digitally signed.");
}
```

**Explanation:** The `loadSignatures` method retrieves all signatures in the specified document. The collection’s count helps determine if any signatures are present.

### Load Signatures from a Stream

#### Overview

Loading signatures using streams provides flexibility, especially when dealing with documents not stored on disk.

**Step 1: Import Required Classes**

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
```

**Step 2: Create an InputStream and Load Signatures**

```java
InputStream stream = new FileInputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Digitally signed.docx");
try {
    DigitalSignatureCollection digitalSignatures =
            DigitalSignatureUtil.loadSignatures(stream);

    if (digitalSignatures.getCount() > 0) {
        System.out.println("Document is digitally signed.");
    }
} finally {
    if (stream != null) stream.close();
}
```

**Explanation:** This method demonstrates reading a document through an InputStream, allowing you to work with files from various sources.

### Remove All Signatures Using File Paths

#### Overview

Removing digital signatures might be necessary when revoking previous approvals or modifying the document’s content.

**Step 1: Import Required Class**

```java
import com.aspose.words.DigitalSignatureUtil;
```

**Step 2: Use `removeAllSignatures` Method**

```java
DigitalSignatureUtil.removeAllSignatures(
        "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Digitally signed.docx",
        "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/UnsignedDocument.docx");
```

**Explanation:** This command clears all digital signatures from the specified document and saves it as a new file.

### Remove All Signatures Using Streams

#### Overview

For applications requiring stream-based processing, removing signatures via InputStream and OutputStream can be advantageous.

**Step 1: Import Required Classes**

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
```

**Step 2: Remove Signatures Using Streams**

```java
InputStream streamIn = new FileInputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Digitally signed.docx");
try {
    OutputStream streamOut = new FileOutputStream(
            "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/UnsignedDocumentFromStream.docx");

    try {
        DigitalSignatureUtil.removeAllSignatures(streamIn, streamOut);
    } finally {
        if (streamOut != null) streamOut.close();
    }
} finally {
    if (streamIn != null) streamIn.close();
}
```

**Explanation:** This approach allows you to handle documents dynamically without directly accessing the file system.

### Sign a Document

#### Overview

Signing a document digitally is essential for verifying its origin and integrity. This step involves using an X.509 certificate stored in PKCS#12 format.

**Step 1: Import Required Classes**

```java
import com.aspose.words.CertificateHolder;
import com.aspose.words.DigitalSignatureUtil;
import com.aspose.words.SignOptions;
import java.util.Date;
```

**Step 2: Create a Certificate Holder and Sign the Document**

```java
CertificateHolder certificateHolder = CertificateHolder.create(
        "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/morzal.pfx", "aw");

SignOptions signOptions = new SignOptions();
signOptions.setComments("My comment");
signOptions.setSignTime(new Date());

InputStream streamIn = new FileInputStream(
        "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Document.docx");
try {
    OutputStream streamOut = new FileOutputStream(
            "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SignedDocument.docx");

    try {
        DigitalSignatureUtil.sign(streamIn, streamOut, certificateHolder, signOptions);
    } finally {
        if (streamOut != null) streamOut.close();
    }
} finally {
    if (streamIn != null) streamIn.close();
}
```

**Explanation:** The `create` method initializes a CertificateHolder from a PKCS#12 file. The SignOptions class allows you to specify additional signing details.

### Sign Encrypted Document

#### Overview

Signing an encrypted document requires decrypting it first, which is facilitated by setting the decryption password in the sign options.

**Step 1: Import Required Classes**

```java
import com.aspose.words.CertificateHolder;
import com.aspose.words.DigitalSignatureUtil;
import com.aspose.words.SignOptions;
import java.util.Date;
```

**Step 2: Sign the Encrypted Document with Decryption Password**

```java
CertificateHolder certificateHolder = CertificateHolder.create(
        "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/morzal.pfx", "aw");

SignOptions signOptions = new SignOptions();
signOptions.setComments("My comment on encrypted document");
signOptions.setDecryptionPassword("your-password-here");
signOptions.setSignTime(new Date());

InputStream streamIn = new FileInputStream(
        "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/EncryptedDocument.docx");
try {
    OutputStream streamOut = new FileOutputStream(
            "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SignedEncryptedDocument.docx");

    try {
        DigitalSignatureUtil.sign(streamIn, streamOut, certificateHolder, signOptions);
    } finally {
        if (streamOut != null) streamOut.close();
    }
} finally {
    if (streamIn != null) streamIn.close();
}
```

**Explanation:** When signing an encrypted document, setting the decryption password in `SignOptions` allows Aspose.Words to decrypt and sign the document.
