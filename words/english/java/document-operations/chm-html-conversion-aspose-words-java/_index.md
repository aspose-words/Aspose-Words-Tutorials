# Convert CHM Files to HTML Using Aspose.Words for Java

## Introduction

Converting Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files into HTML can be challenging due to the complexity of maintaining internal link integrity. This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to use Aspose.Words for Java for effective CHM to HTML conversion, preserving essential links.

In this tutorial, we'll cover:
- Using `ChmLoadOptions` to manage original filenames
- Step-by-step implementation with code examples
- Real-world applications and integration possibilities

By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll understand how to efficiently convert CHM files using Aspose.Words for Java.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
- **IDE**: Preferably IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- **Aspose.Words for Java Library**: Version 25.3 or later

You should also be comfortable with basic Java programming and using Maven or Gradle build systems.

## Setting Up Aspose.Words

Include the Aspose.Words library in your project:

### Maven Dependency
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-words</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle Dependency
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-words:25.3'
```

#### License Acquisition
Aspose.Words is a commercial product, but you can start with a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/words/java/) to explore its features. For extended evaluation or additional functionality, consider obtaining a temporary license from [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/). For long-term use, purchase a license [directly through Aspose](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

#### Basic Initialization
Ensure your project is set up to include Aspose.Words:
```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;
import com.aspose.words.ChmLoadOptions;

public class ChmToHtmlConverter {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Initialize a license if you have one (optional)
        // License license = new License();
        // license.setLicense("path/to/your/license.lic");

        // Your conversion logic will go here
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Handling Original Filenames in CHM Files

#### Overview
Maintaining internal links during CHM to HTML conversion requires setting the original filename using `ChmLoadOptions`. This ensures all link references remain valid.

##### Step 1: Create ChmLoadOptions Instance
Create an instance of `ChmLoadOptions` and set the original filename:
```java
import com.aspose.words.ChmLoadOptions;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;

// Create a ChmLoadOptions object
ChmLoadOptions loadOptions = new ChmLoadOptions();
loadOptions.setOriginalFileName("amhelp.chm"); // Set the original CHM filename
```
**Explanation**: Setting `setOriginalFileName` helps Aspose.Words understand the document's context, ensuring links within the file are correctly resolved.

##### Step 2: Load the CHM File
Load your CHM file into an Aspose.Words `Document` object using the specified options:
```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;

// Read the CHM file as a byte arrayyte[] chmData = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Document with ms-its links.chm"));

// Load the document using ChmLoadOptions
Document doc = new Document(new ByteArrayInputStream(chmData), loadOptions);
```
##### Step 3: Save to HTML
Save the loaded document as an HTML file:
```java
// Save the document as HTML
doc.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ExChmLoadOptions.OriginalFileName.html");
```
**Troubleshooting Tips**: If links are not working, verify that `setOriginalFileName` matches the base filename used within the CHM's internal structure and ensure your CHM file path is correct.

## Practical Applications
This conversion method benefits scenarios like:
1. **Documentation Portals**: Converting help files into web-friendly HTML for online documentation portals.
2. **Software Support Pages**: Transforming CHM files to HTML for company support websites.
3. **Legacy Systems Migration**: Updating old software using CHM files to platforms requiring HTML format.

## Performance Considerations
For large documents:
- Optimize memory usage by processing in chunks if possible.
- Evaluate server-side execution of Aspose.Words for better resource management.

## Conclusion
You've mastered converting CHM files into HTML with Aspose.Words for Java while preserving internal links. Explore more features of Aspose.Words through their [official documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/) to enhance your skills further.

## FAQ Section
1. **What is the difference between CHM and HTML file formats?**
   - CHM (Compiled HTML Help) files are binary help documentation, while HTML files are plain text viewed by web browsers.
2. **How do I handle broken links after conversion?**
   - Ensure `ChmLoadOptions.setOriginalFileName` is set correctly to maintain link integrity.
3. **Can Aspose.Words convert other file formats besides CHM and HTML?**
   - Yes, it supports many document formats including DOCX, PDF. Check the [Aspose.Words documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/) for details.
4. **Is there a limit to the size of documents Aspose.Words can handle?**
   - While robust, very large files may require increased memory allocation or server-side processing.
5. **How do I purchase a license for Aspose.Words?**
   - Visit [Aspose's purchasing page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) for more information on acquiring a license.
