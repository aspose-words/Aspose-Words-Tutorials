- Detecting document encryption status and digital signatures.
- Extracting images from documents effectively.

With these skills, you'll be well-equipped to tackle complex document processing tasks with ease. Let's dive into the prerequisites before setting up your environment!

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed.
- Basic understanding of Java programming and exception handling.
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management.

### Required Libraries and Environment Setup
Ensure your project includes the Aspose.Words library. Below are the setup instructions using Maven and Gradle:

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
  <artifactId>aspose-words</artifactId>
  <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-words:25.3'
```

### License Acquisition Steps
You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license to explore Aspose.Words for Java's full capabilities before purchasing.

## Setting Up Aspose.Words

To begin using Aspose.Words, integrate the library into your project as shown above and set up a valid license. Here’s how you can initialize:

```java
import com.aspose.words.License;

License license = new License();
license.setLicense("Aspose.Words.lic");
```

This setup allows you to leverage all features without any limitations.

## Implementation Guide

### Handling FileCorruptedException

**Overview:**
Handling file corruption gracefully is crucial for robust document processing applications.

#### Catching the Exception
To catch a `FileCorruptedException` when loading a potentially corrupted document, use the following code:

```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;
import com.aspose.words.FileCorruptedException;

try {
    Document doc = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Corrupted document.docx");
} catch (FileCorruptedException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
```
**Explanation:** This code attempts to load a document and catches exceptions related to file corruption, logging the error message for further investigation.

### Detecting Encoding in HTML Files

**Overview:**
Detecting the correct encoding of an HTML file ensures that it is processed accurately.

#### Detecting Encoding
Use Aspose.Words to detect and verify file formats and encodings:

```java
import com.aspose.words.FileFormatInfo;
import com.aspose.words.LoadFormat;

FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.detectFileFormat("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Document.html");
System.out.println("Load Format: " + LoadFormat.toString(info.getLoadFormat()));
System.out.println("Encoding: " + (info.getEncoding() != null ? info.getEncoding().name() : "None"));
```
**Explanation:** This snippet detects the file format and encoding of an HTML document, ensuring it matches expected values.

### Mapping Media Types to File Formats

**Overview:**
Converting media type strings to Aspose's load/save formats enhances interoperability with various content types.

#### Using Content Type Utilities
Here's how you can map a media type string:

```java
import com.aspose.words.FileFormatUtil;

FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.contentTypeToSaveFormat("image/jpeg");
System.out.println("Save Format: " + info.getLoadFormat());
```
**Explanation:** This code maps the `image/jpeg` content type to Aspose's save format, aiding in file conversion tasks.

### Detecting Document Encryption

**Overview:**
Detecting whether a document is encrypted ensures secure handling and access control.

#### Checking for Encryption
To check encryption status:

```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;
import com.aspose.words.OdtSaveOptions;

Document doc = new Document();
OdtSaveOptions saveOptions = new OdtSaveOptions(com.aspose.words.SaveFormat.ODT);
saveOptions.setPassword("MyPassword");
doc.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/File.DetectDocumentEncryption.odt", saveOptions);

FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.detectFileFormat("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/File.DetectDocumentEncryption.odt");
System.out.println("Is Encrypted: " + info.isEncrypted());
```
**Explanation:** This snippet saves a document with encryption and then checks if it is encrypted.

### Detecting Digital Signatures

**Overview:**
Verifying digital signatures ensures the authenticity of documents.

#### Signature Detection
To detect digital signatures:

```java
import com.aspose.words.FileFormatInfo;
import org.bouncycastle.cert.jcajce.JcaCertStore;

FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.detectFileFormat("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Document.docx");
System.out.println("Has Digital Signature: " + info.hasDigitalSignature());
```
**Explanation:** This code checks if a document contains digital signatures, confirming its integrity.

### Saving Documents to Detected Formats

**Overview:**
Automatically saving documents in the correct format based on detected file types optimizes workflow efficiency.

#### Auto-Save Functionality
Here's how you can save a document in its detected format:

```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;
import java.io.FileInputStream;

FileInputStream docStream = new FileInputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Word document with missing file extension");
FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.detectFileFormat(docStream);
Document doc = new Document(docStream);

int saveFormat = FileFormatUtil.loadFormatToSaveFormat(info.getLoadFormat());
doc.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/Detected_Format.docx", saveFormat);
```
**Explanation:** This snippet detects the format of a document without an extension and saves it accordingly.

### Extracting Images from Documents

**Overview:**
Extracting images from documents can be essential for content repurposing or analysis.

#### Image Extraction Process
To extract images:

```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;
import com.aspose.words.NodeCollection;
import com.aspose.words.Shape;

Document doc = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Images.docx");
NodeCollection shapes = doc.getChildNodes(com.aspose.words.NodeType.SHAPE, true);

int imageIndex = 0;
for (Shape shape : (Iterable<Shape>) shapes) {
    if (shape.hasImage()) {
        String imageFileName = "ExtractedImage_" + imageIndex + "." + 
                FileFormatUtil.imageTypeToExtension(shape.getImageData().getImageType());
        shape.getImageData().save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/" + imageFileName);
        imageIndex++;
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** This code iterates through shapes in a document, saving each image it finds.
