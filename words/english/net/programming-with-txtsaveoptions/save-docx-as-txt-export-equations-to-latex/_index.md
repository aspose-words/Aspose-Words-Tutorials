# Save docx as txt – Export equations to LaTeX

Ever needed to **save docx as txt** but worried that the math inside would turn into gibberish? You're not alone. Many developers hit that wall when they try to extract plain text from Word files that contain Office Math objects. The good news? With a few lines of C# and the right options, you can **convert equations to LaTeX** while the rest of the document becomes ordinary text.

In this tutorial we’ll walk through the whole process—no vague references, just a concrete, runnable example. By the end you’ll know exactly **how to save text** from a `.docx` file, keep your equations readable, and avoid the usual pitfalls that turn your output into a mess of symbols.

> **What you’ll get:** a complete code sample, an explanation of each setting, tips for edge cases, and a quick verification step so you can be sure the conversion worked.

---

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have:

* **.NET 6** (or any recent .NET runtime) installed.
* The **Aspose.Words for .NET** NuGet package – it ships the `Document` class and the `TxtSaveOptions` we’ll need.
* A Word file (`.docx`) that contains at least one Office Math equation. If you don’t have one, create a simple document with an equation via **Insert → Equation** in Microsoft Word.

That’s it—no extra libraries, no heavyweight PDF converters. Just plain C# and Aspose.Words.

---

## Step 1 – Load the Word document

First thing’s first: we need a `Document` instance that points to the source `.docx`. The constructor expects a file path, so replace the placeholder with your actual location.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;

// Load the source DOCX file
Document doc = new Document(@"C:\Docs\input.docx");
```

*Why this matters:* Loading the file gives us access to every node inside the Word structure, including the hidden Office Math objects that most plain‑text exporters simply skip.

---

## Step 2 – Tell Aspose you want LaTeX for equations

The magic happens in `TxtSaveOptions`. By setting `OfficeMathExportMode` to `LaTeX`, the library converts each equation into its LaTeX representation instead of dumping the raw MathML or stripping it entirely.

```csharp
// Configure export options: equations become LaTeX strings
TxtSaveOptions txtOptions = new TxtSaveOptions
{
    OfficeMathExportMode = OfficeMathExportMode.LaTeX,
    // Optional: preserve line breaks as they appear in Word
    PreserveTableLayout = true
};
```

*Why this matters:* Without this flag, your output would either lose the equations altogether or contain unreadable XML. LaTeX is lightweight, widely supported, and perfect for downstream processing (e.g., feeding into a Markdown renderer).

---

## Step 3 – Save the document as plain text

Now we combine the document and the options, then write the result to a `.txt` file. The path can be absolute or relative; Aspose will handle the encoding automatically (UTF‑8 by default).

```csharp
// Export the document to a plain‑text file with LaTeX equations
doc.Save(@"C:\Docs\Equations.txt", txtOptions);
```

When you open `Equations.txt`, you’ll see normal sentences interspersed with LaTeX snippets like `\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx`. That’s the **convert docx to txt** step completed.

---

## Step 4 – Verify the output (optional but recommended)

A quick sanity check saves you hours of debugging later. Open the generated file in any text editor and look for two things:

1. **Plain sentences** – they should match the original Word paragraphs.
2. **LaTeX blocks** – each equation should start with a backslash (`\`) and look like proper LaTeX code.

```csharp
string output = File.ReadAllText(@"C:\Docs\Equations.txt");
Console.WriteLine(output.Substring(0, 500)); // preview first 500 chars
```

If the preview includes something like `\frac{a}{b}` where you expected an equation, you’ve succeeded.

---

## Common Variations & Edge Cases

### Converting multiple files in a batch

If you need to **convert docx to txt** for a whole folder, wrap the logic in a `foreach` loop. Remember to reuse `TxtSaveOptions` to avoid unnecessary allocations.

```csharp
TxtSaveOptions batchOptions = new TxtSaveOptions
{
    OfficeMathExportMode = OfficeMathExportMode.LaTeX
};

foreach (string file in Directory.GetFiles(@"C:\Docs\Batch", "*.docx"))
{
    Document batchDoc = new Document(file);
    string txtPath = Path.ChangeExtension(file, ".txt");
    batchDoc.Save(txtPath, batchOptions);
}
```

### Handling non‑Latin characters

Aspose defaults to UTF‑8, which covers most scripts. If you target an older system that expects ANSI, set the encoding explicitly:

```csharp
txtOptions.Encoding = Encoding.GetEncoding("windows-1252");
```

### When equations are images, not Office Math

If the source document uses image‑based equations, Aspose can’t turn them into LaTeX (there’s nothing to parse). In that case you’ll get a placeholder text like `[Equation]`. Consider using an OCR library or manually replacing those images.

---

## Pro Tips & Gotchas

* **Pro tip:** Turn on `PreserveTableLayout` (as shown in Step 2) if your document relies on tables for layout. It keeps column spacing roughly intact in the plain‑text output.
* **Watch out for hidden sections:** Word can store text in headers, footers, or even comments. `TxtSaveOptions` exports those by default, but you can disable them with `ExportHeadersFooters = false` if you only need body content.
* **Performance tip:** For huge documents (hundreds of pages), reuse the same `TxtSaveOptions` instance and consider streaming the output with `doc.Save(Stream, txtOptions)` to reduce memory pressure.

## Full Working Example (Copy‑Paste Ready)

Below is a self‑contained program you can drop into a console app. It includes all `using` statements, error handling, and comments to keep you from getting lost.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Path to the source DOCX – change to your file location
        string sourcePath = @"C:\Docs\input.docx";

        // Path for the resulting TXT file
        string outputPath = @"C:\Docs\Equations.txt";

        try
        {
            // 1️⃣ Load the Word document
            Document doc = new Document(sourcePath);

            // 2️⃣ Configure export: equations become LaTeX
            TxtSaveOptions options = new TxtSaveOptions
            {
                OfficeMathExportMode = OfficeMathExportMode.LaTeX,
                PreserveTableLayout = true,
                // Optional: keep headers/footers out of the output
                // ExportHeadersFooters = false
            };

            // 3️⃣ Save as plain text
            doc.Save(outputPath, options);

            // 4️⃣ Quick verification
            Console.WriteLine("✅ Conversion finished!");
            Console.WriteLine("First 300 characters of the result:");
            Console.WriteLine(File.ReadAllText(outputPath).Substring(0, 300));
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.Error.WriteLine($"❌ Oops! Something went wrong: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

Run the program, open `Equations.txt`, and you’ll see your Word content alongside LaTeX‑formatted math. That’s the entire **how to save text** workflow in one tidy script.
