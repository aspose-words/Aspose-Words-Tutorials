# Resolve Font Names

## Introduction

Hey there, fellow coder! If you've ever found yourself wrestling with font issues when saving Word documents as HTML, you're not alone. Fonts can be tricky, but don't worry; I've got your back. Today, we’re diving into how to resolve font names in your Word documents using Aspose.Words for .NET. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step, ensuring your fonts look just right in HTML format.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let’s make sure you have everything you need:

1. Aspose.Words for .NET: If you haven’t already, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/).
2. A Valid License: You can purchase a license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or get a temporary license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C# and .NET: This tutorial assumes you're comfortable with basic programming concepts in C#.
4. Visual Studio: Any version that supports .NET framework.

Now that we have our prerequisites sorted, let’s jump into the action!

## Import Namespaces

Before we start coding, ensure you’ve imported the necessary namespaces into your project. This is crucial for accessing Aspose.Words functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Setting Up the Document Directory

First things first, let's set up the path to your document directory. This is where your Word document is located and where you’ll save your output.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Explanation:
Here, `dataDir` holds the path to your document directory. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path on your system.

## Step 2: Loading the Word Document

Next, we need to load the Word document that we want to process. This document should have the fonts that you want to resolve.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Missing font.docx");
```

Explanation:
We create a `Document` object and load the Word document named "Missing font.docx" from our `dataDir`.

## Step 3: Configuring HTML Save Options

Now, let's set up the options for saving the document as HTML. Here, we'll ensure that font names are resolved correctly.

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Html)
{
    PrettyFormat = true,
    ResolveFontNames = true
};
```

Explanation:
We create an instance of `HtmlSaveOptions` with `SaveFormat.Html`. The `PrettyFormat` option makes the HTML output more readable, and `ResolveFontNames` ensures that font names are resolved.

## Step 4: Saving the Document as HTML

Finally, we save the document as an HTML file using the configured save options.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithHtmlSaveOptions.ResolveFontNames.html", saveOptions);
```

Explanation:
We call the `Save` method on the `Document` object, specifying the output path and the save options we configured. This will generate an HTML file with the font names resolved.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these steps, you’ve successfully resolved font names when converting a Word document to HTML using Aspose.Words for .NET. This not only ensures that your fonts are displayed correctly but also makes your HTML output look polished and professional. Happy coding!
