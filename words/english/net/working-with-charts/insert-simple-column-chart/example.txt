//ExStep:0-
// Create a new Word document instance.
Document doc = new Document();

//ExStep:1-
// Create a DocumentBuilder to easily insert elements into the document.
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

//ExStep:2-
// Insert a column chart shape with specified width (432) and height (252).
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Column, 432, 252);

//ExStep:3-
// Retrieve the chart object from the shape for further manipulation.
Chart chart = shape.Chart;

//ExStep:4-
// Access the series collection of the chart.
ChartSeriesCollection seriesColl = chart.Series;
// Print the number of series in the chart to the console.
Console.WriteLine(seriesColl.Count);

//ExStep:5-
// Remove any default series that were automatically generated when the chart was created.
seriesColl.Clear();

//ExStep:6-
// Define an array of category names for chart data.
string[] categories = new string[] { "Category 1", "Category 2" };

//ExStep:7-
// Add multiple series to the chart with category names and data values.
seriesColl.Add("Aspose Series 1", categories, new double[] { 1, 2 });
seriesColl.Add("Aspose Series 2", categories, new double[] { 3, 4 });
seriesColl.Add("Aspose Series 3", categories, new double[] { 5, 6 });
seriesColl.Add("Aspose Series 4", categories, new double[] { 7, 8 });
seriesColl.Add("Aspose Series 5", categories, new double[] { 9, 10 });

//ExStep:8-
// Save the document with the inserted chart to the specified file path.
doc.Save("WorkingWithCharts.InsertSimpleColumnChart.docx");
//ExEnd
