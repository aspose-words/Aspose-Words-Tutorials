# Create PDF from DOCX in C# – Complete Programming Guide

Ever wondered how to **create PDF from DOCX** without wrestling with messy third‑party tools? You're not alone. Many developers hit a wall when they need to *convert Word to PDF* on the fly, especially when the source document contains floating images or text boxes.  

The good news is that with Aspose.Words for .NET you can **create PDF from DOCX** in just a few lines of code, and you’ll also learn **how to export shapes** so they keep their exact layout in the resulting file.  

In this tutorial we’ll walk through the whole process, from loading the source `.docx` to configuring the save options that make the conversion look pixel‑perfect. By the end you’ll be able to **save document as PDF**, handle common edge cases, and feel confident tweaking the settings for your own projects.

## What You’ll Need

Before we dive in, make sure you have the following:

- **Aspose.Words for .NET** (latest version as of 2025). You can grab it via NuGet: `Install-Package Aspose.Words`.
- A .NET development environment – Visual Studio, Rider, or even VS Code with the C# extension works fine.
- A sample Word file (`input.docx`) that contains at least one floating shape (image, text box, or SmartArt).  
- Basic familiarity with C# syntax – nothing fancy, just the usual `using` statements and `Main` method.

That’s it. No extra PDFs, no COM interop, no Office installation required.

## Step 1 – Load the DOCX File (create pdf from docx)

The first thing you have to do is tell Aspose.Words where your source document lives. This is the **create pdf from docx** moment where the library parses the Word file into an in‑memory `Document` object.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;

// Step 1: Load the source Word document
Document document = new Document("YOUR_DIRECTORY/input.docx");
```

> **Why this matters:**  
> Loading the file creates a full representation of the Word document, including paragraphs, tables, and, crucially, any floating shapes. If the file can’t be found, Aspose throws a `FileNotFoundException`, so you might want to wrap this in a try/catch block for production code.

## Step 2 – Set Up PDF Save Options (convert word to pdf)

Now that the document is in memory, we need to tell Aspose how we want the PDF to look. This is where **convert word to pdf** really happens under the hood.

```csharp
// Step 2: Create PDF save options
PdfSaveOptions pdfSaveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
```

At this point you could stop and just call `document.Save("output.pdf")`, but we want a bit more control—specifically, we want to preserve the layout of any floating shapes.

## Step 3 – Export Floating Shapes as Inline Tags (how to export shapes)

Floating shapes are a common stumbling block when you **save document as PDF**. By default, Aspose tries to keep them floating, which can shift their position on the page. Setting `ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag` forces the shapes to become inline elements, guaranteeing they stay exactly where you placed them in the Word file.

```csharp
// Step 3: Export floating shapes as inline tags (preserves their layout in the PDF)
pdfSaveOptions.ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag = true;
```

> **Pro tip:** If you *don’t* need the shapes to stay inline, set this flag to `false` and let Aspose render them as separate objects. That can be useful for PDFs where you want the shapes to be selectable independently.

## Step 4 – Save the Document as PDF (save document as pdf)

Finally, we write the PDF to disk using the options we just configured. This is the moment where you truly **save document as pdf**.

```csharp
// Step 4: Save the document as a PDF file with the configured options
document.Save("YOUR_DIRECTORY/output.pdf", pdfSaveOptions);
```

When the `Save` call completes, you should see `output.pdf` sitting next to your source file, looking identical to the original Word layout—including any floating images or text boxes.

### Full Working Example

Here’s the complete, ready‑to‑run snippet that ties everything together:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Words;
using Aspose.Words.Saving;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        try
        {
            // Load the source Word document
            Document document = new Document("YOUR_DIRECTORY/input.docx");

            // Create PDF save options
            PdfSaveOptions pdfSaveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();

            // Export floating shapes as inline tags (preserves their layout in the PDF)
            pdfSaveOptions.ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag = true;

            // Save the document as a PDF file with the configured options
            document.Save("YOUR_DIRECTORY/output.pdf", pdfSaveOptions);

            Console.WriteLine("✅ PDF created successfully!");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"❌ An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

Run the program, open `output.pdf`, and you’ll see that the floating shapes line up exactly as they did in `input.docx`. Mission accomplished.

## Common Variations & Edge Cases

### Converting Multiple Files in a Batch

If you need to **convert word to pdf** for a whole folder, just wrap the logic in a `foreach` loop:

```csharp
string[] files = Directory.GetFiles("YOUR_DIRECTORY", "*.docx");
foreach (var file in files)
{
    Document doc = new Document(file);
    string pdfPath = Path.ChangeExtension(file, ".pdf");
    doc.Save(pdfPath, pdfSaveOptions);
}
```

### Password‑Protected Documents

Aspose.Words can open encrypted Word files by supplying a `LoadOptions` object:

```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions { Password = "mySecret" };
Document protectedDoc = new Document("protected.docx", loadOptions);
protectedDoc.Save("protected.pdf", pdfSaveOptions);
```

### Large Documents & Memory Management

For **how to convert docx** files that are hundreds of pages long, consider enabling *memory optimization*:

```csharp
pdfSaveOptions.SaveFormat = SaveFormat.Pdf;
pdfSaveOptions.CompressionLevel = PdfCompressionLevel.Maximum;
```

This reduces the PDF size and speeds up the conversion.

### When You *Don’t* Want Inline Shapes

If you prefer the shapes to stay floating (perhaps you need them selectable in the PDF), simply set the flag to `false`:

```csharp
pdfSaveOptions.ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag = false;
```

The resulting PDF will render the shapes as separate objects, which can be useful for accessibility tools.

## Tips & Tricks from the Trenches

- **Pro tip:** Always test with a document that contains a mixture of inline and floating elements. That’s the fastest way to spot layout drift.
- **Watch out for:** Custom fonts that aren’t installed on the server. Aspose will embed missing fonts automatically, but you might need to license the font for commercial use.
- **Performance tip:** Reuse the same `PdfSaveOptions` instance when converting many files. Creating a new object each time adds unnecessary overhead.
- **Debugging tip:** If the output PDF looks blank, double‑check that the source file path is correct and that the document actually contains content (you can inspect `document.GetText()` before saving).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this work on .NET Core / .NET 5+?**  
A: Absolutely. Aspose.Words supports .NET Standard 2.0 and later, so the same code runs on .NET Core, .NET 5, .NET 6, and beyond.

**Q: What about converting `.doc` (legacy Word) files?**  
A: The same API handles `.doc` files. Just pass the file path to the `Document` constructor and the library does the heavy lifting.

**Q: Can I set PDF metadata (author, title) while converting?**  
A: Yes. Use `pdfSaveOptions` to assign `PdfDocumentInfo` properties before calling `Save`.

```csharp
pdfSaveOptions.Metadata.Author = "John Doe";
pdfSaveOptions.Metadata.Title = "Converted Document";
```

## Conclusion

You now have a solid, end‑to‑end pattern for how to **create PDF from DOCX** using Aspose.Words for .NET. The guide covered the essential steps to **convert Word to PDF**, showed you **how to export shapes** so they stay in place, and gave you practical tips for batch processing, password‑protected files, and large‑document performance.

Next, you might want to explore **how to convert docx** to other formats (HTML, EPUB) or dig deeper into PDF customization—like adding watermarks, digital signatures, or OCR layers. The same `PdfSaveOptions` object is your gateway to those advanced features.
