//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to insert shapes (text boxes) into a Word document using Aspose.Words. The document is saved in DOCX format with specific compliance options for ISO standards.
//ExStepSummary:0: The code initializes a new document and a document builder for manipulating the document.
//ExStepSummary:1: A shape (text box) is inserted at an absolute position in the document.
//ExStepSummary:2: The rotation of the first shape is set to 30 degrees.
//ExStepSummary:3: A new shape is inserted at a relative position.
//ExStepSummary:4: The rotation of the second shape is also set to 30 degrees.
//ExStepSummary:5: The document is saved with specific OoxmlSaveOptions.

//ExStep:0-
// Creates a new document instance
Document doc = new Document();
// Initializes a DocumentBuilder for the document
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

//ExStep:1-
// Inserts a shape of type TextBox
Shape shape = builder.InsertShape(ShapeType.TextBox, RelativeHorizontalPosition.Page, 100, 
    RelativeVerticalPosition.Page, 100, 50, 50, WrapType.None); // Sets the position and size of the shape
//ExStep:2-
// Rotates the shape by 30 degrees
shape.Rotation = 30.0;
builder.Writeln();

//ExStep:3-
// Inserts another shape of type TextBox at a relative position
shape = builder.InsertShape(ShapeType.TextBox, 50, 50); 
//ExStep:4-
// Rotates the second shape by 30 degrees
shape.Rotation = 30.0;

//ExStep:5-
// Prepares save options for the document
OoxmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new OoxmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Docx)
{
    Compliance = OoxmlCompliance.Iso29500_2008_Transitional // Sets compliance to ISO 29500:2008 Transitional
};

// Saves the document using the specified save options
doc.Save("WorkingWithShapes.InsertShape.docx", saveOptions);
