//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to create a document with a chart using Aspose.Words, set the bounds for the Y-axis, and save the document as a DOCX file. 
// Each step is broken down to provide a clear understanding of the process involved in working with charts in Aspose.Words.
//ExStepSummary:0: Initialize a new document and a DocumentBuilder instance. 
//ExStepSummary:1: Insert a chart into the document and retrieve the chart object. 
//ExStepSummary:2: Clear any existing series from the chart. 
//ExStepSummary:3: Add a new series to the chart with specified categories and values. 
//ExStepSummary:4: Set the minimum and maximum bounds for the Y-axis of the chart. 
//ExStepSummary:5: Save the document to the specified path.

//ExStep:0-
// Create a new Document instance.
Document doc = new Document();
// Initialize DocumentBuilder to build the document.
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

//ExStep:1-
// Insert a column chart into the document.
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Column, 432, 252);
// Retrieve the chart object from the shape.
Chart chart = shape.Chart;

//ExStep:2-
// Clear any existing series from the chart for fresh data.
chart.Series.Clear();

//ExStep:3-
// Define a new series with the name "Aspose Series 1".
chart.Series.Add("Aspose Series 1",
    new string[] { "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4", "Item 5" }, // Set categories for the series.
    new double[] { 1.2, 0.3, 2.1, 2.9, 4.2 });

//ExStep:4-
// Set the minimum bound of the Y-axis.
chart.AxisY.Scaling.Minimum = new AxisBound(0);
chart.AxisY.Scaling.Maximum = new AxisBound(6);

//ExStep:5-
// Save the document with the chart to the specified path.
doc.Save("WorkingWithCharts.BoundsOfAxis.docx");
